## Overview

An online learning portal designed for students and colleges to conduct exams and live classes

## Description

This online learning portal enables seamless educational operations by allowing students and colleges to enroll, conduct exams, and host live classes. The application integrates Jitsi for real-time video functionality, with Jitsi servers hosted on AWS for reliability and scalability. The backend application is deployed on Heroku, ensuring robust performance, while the frontend is deployed on Netlify for fast and efficient delivery. Designed to facilitate uninterrupted learning, this platform bridges the gap between students and educational institutions in a digital-first world.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using Angular and Material UI, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables and Figma tokens.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Frontend.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling Angular components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.
- **Node & Express**: Backend
- **Jitsi**: For live learning lessons

## Challenges and Learnings

I faced numerous challenges as this was my first real life project but also had so many learnings. Some of which are mentioned below

- Setting up **Jitsi** servers on AWS involved handling complex configurations, ensuring security for live sessions, and managing server scalability to handle multiple concurrent users.
- Customizing Jitsi to align with applicationâ€™s needs required diving deep into its API and understanding its inner workings.
- Gained experience in deploying and configuring real-time communication tools on cloud platforms.
- Coordinating deployments across Heroku (backend), Netlify (frontend), and AWS (Jitsi servers) which inturn imporved understanding of cloud services like Heroku, Netlify, and AWS.

## Outcome

- **LIE** : The project successfully created a seamless online learning platform, enabling students and colleges to conduct exams and live classes efficiently. It enhanced accessibility to education while ensuring scalability, security, and smooth operations across all components.
- **TRUTH** : The project is far from perfect and probably not even responsive, but did taught me a lot of things(more on the architecture side) and till this day I am proud of this project.
